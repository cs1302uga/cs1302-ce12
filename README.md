## Questions

In your notes, clearly answer the following questions. These instructions assume that you are 
logged into the Nike server. 

**NOTE:** If a step requires you to enter in a command, please provide in your notes the full 
command that you typed to make the related action happen. If context is necessary (e.g., the 
command depends on your present working directory), then please note that context as well.

### Getting Started

1. Use Git to clone the repository for this exercise onto Nike into a subdirectory called `cs1302-ce12`:

   ```
   $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-ce12.git
   ```

1. Change into the `cs1302-ce12` directory that was just created and look around. There should be
   multiple Java files contained within the directory structure. To see a listing of all of the 
   files under the `src` subdirectory, use the `find` command as follows:
   
   ```
   $ find src
   ```

   For each Java file under the `src` subdirectory, fill out a table similar to the following:
   
   | File Name | Java Type? | FQN | Depends On | Line Count |
   |-----------|------------|-----|------------|------------|
   |-----------|------------|-----|------------|------------|
   |-----------|------------|-----|------------|------------|
   |-----------|------------|-----|------------|------------|

   The "Java Type" column should list the outermost type in the file (e.g., class, interface, enum, etc). 
   The "Depends On" column should list any Java types in the starter code that the file
   is dependent upon. To determine the "Line Count", you may use the `wc` command.
   
1. In your notes, draw a complete, proper UML diagram for all of the code contained in the
   starter code. You might need to devote an entire page to this. We recommend using a pencil.
